There, I went from grade one to grade six. This school is near my home. So I could just go to school by riding the bike that my dad bought. During primary school, I was very active in joining clubs or associations. In sixth grade, I successfully passed the Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) exam with 2A 3B results.</p>

There, I went from form one to form five. This school is very nearest from my home. So I could just go to school by walked that just take 5 minutes. During primary school, I was very active in joining clubs or associations. In form three and form five, I successfully passed the Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3 (PT3) exam and the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) exam with excellent results.</p>

<p class="dotted">Then, upon ended from secondary school, I was able to continue my university studies by applying for a course Diploma in Office Management and Technology in UiTM Dungun, Terengganu. The course took me about two and a half years from 2018 to 2020. I can't forget when I got a dean for three consecutive semesters and it made me even more excited to continue studying at a higher level.</p>
